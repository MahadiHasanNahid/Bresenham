This is an experiment in working with three technologies: OpenGL/GLUT, bitmaps, and the Bresenham Line Algorithm. I created an extremely basic bitmap library to store a map, which was used in conjunction with the Bresenham Line Algorithm to draw a line from the center of a window to the mouse location. The insights and code developed while working on this project were then used in my Monte Carlo Simulator.

The Makefile and GLUT include path for this project are specific to OS X because I am not very familiar with GNU Autotools yet. Also, very little to no documentation is provided because this was more a tech demo than an actual project.

This software is released under the GPL "as-is" without any warranty.
